  If they say their favorite subject is history, they be holding grudges
    </p>
    <p2>Bartering should make a comeback. I traded my barber a haircut for a new logo</p2>
    <p>
      This a space to dump all the 
      thoughts and observations I can't do nun with
    </p>
    
    <p>Maybe people would care more about Julian Assange if he could rap. 
      I will not elaborate further</p>
    
    <p>
      Youtube is wild. Watch a few vids on exercise and calisthenics
      and next thing you know, your feed is full of borderline fascist shit</p>
    
    
    <p>When your playlist has been on shuffle for a while, you can't just change the song. The feng shui will be ruined.</p>
    
    <p>I strut into class, late, with food in my hand and not a care in the world. And then have
    the audacity to make a ruckus with my friend lol</p>
    
    <p>
      I just want free healthcare and European-style public transportation, is that so much
      to ask for??
    </p>

      The FTX fraud stuff is already bad, but only gets worse when you start diving into
      their personal lives. I think what makes it even worse it that this is the future ruling class:
      A bunch of polyamours weirdos who, through either narcissicm or disability, delude themselves
      into viewing themselves as a tortured genius instead of nerd who was born into the right family with 
      the right connections. 
    </p>
    
    
    
      <p>
      The steady transition of the ruling class from recognizably evil old guys, titans 
      of industry who use their power to crush and manipulate the rest of us, to pale, skinny shut-in nerds
      makes me so goddamnned angry I cannot even put into words. You expect me to bow down...to HIM???? 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Last thing imma say.........if you lost that much money in some countries, they'll lock your ass up for financial crimes.
      Assuming they don't execute you
    </p>
    
     <p>
      Upper-middle class people who LARP as working class be talmbout "eat the rich"...bro you are the rich??
      We're eating you
    </p>

      The French Left and existentialists of the 20th century have produced some of my favorites works.
      It just sucks that they were all sex-fiends

      I used to watch so many damn movies. I keep a list. It organized by date watched and each one contains a mini-review and some other info like who I 
      watched it with. But over time, the list has started to become more bare. Watching twenty movies in a month soon becomes five. five soon drops to one. Soon I
      no longer movies at all. 
    </p>
    
     <p>
      I'm not even being dramatic. In January 2022, I watched 30 movies. The following month I didn't watch any. In April, the number went up again, but it has been steadily decreasing ever since.
       This month, December 2022, I watched two movies: Hellraiser 3 & Hellraiser 4. And they were both awful.
    </p>
    
     <p>
      The more films you watch, the quicker you realize that most movies are garbage. For every verifiable classic, there are probably a couple hundred that
       are almost unwatchable.
    </p>

      I want to drop out lol
    </p>

      The Twitter files must be having those former Twitter execs sweating bullets. 
      If I was revealed to have been involved in collusion with the State in suppressing
      free speech with bogus justifications I would be also be nervous. This is what happens 
      when you work with the FBI. The CIA woulda burned all those documents.
    </p>

      They've been saying Russia is running out of weaponry since they started the invasion. 
       Something tells me they're not running out of weaponry.
    </p>

      Continued thought: With further troop mobilizations, as well as the possibility of Belarus entering the conflict, 
      this war might get ugly and get ugly very fast. 
    </p>

      Rappers these days do anything but release music. They're all about fashion now. That'd normal be fine, 
      it's just that most of the dudes can't design for shit, but it only gets more worse
      cause their dickriding fanboys buy the shitty merch anyway. I'm talking about Playboi Carti btw
    </p>
    
     <p>If Kanye is going to be anti-semetic, the least he could do is be anti-semetic and drop music, like c'mon</p>
    
    <p>People complain that Westside Gunn and the Griselda rappers release too much music. Good. Prolific rappers reign supreme. Especially if 80% 
    of everything they drop is solid</p>
