  If they say their favorite subject is history, they be holding grudges
    </p>
    <p2>Bartering should make a comeback. I love trading my labor for stuff. I traded with barber
    a few times. I did a logo for him in exchange for a haircut. Fuck currency.</p2>
    <p>
      This a space to dump all the 
      thoughts and observations I can't do nun with
    </p>
    
    <p>Maybe people would care more about Julian Assange if he could rap. 
      I will not elaborate further</p>
    
    <p>
      Youtube is wild. Watch a few vids on exercise and calisthenics
      and next thing you know, your feed is full of borderline fascist shit</p>
    
    
    <p>When your playlist has been on shuffle for a while, you can't just change the song. The feng shui will be ruined.</p>
    
    <p>I strut into class, late, with food in my hand and not a care in the world. And then have
    the audacity to make a ruckus with my friend lol</p>
    
    <p>
      I just want free healthcare and European-style public transportation, is that so much
      to ask for??
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The FTX fraud stuff is already bad, but only gets worse when you start diving into
      their personal lives. I think what makes it even worse it that this is the future ruling class:
      A bunch of polyamours weirdos who, through either narcissicm or disability, delude themselves
      into viewing themselves as a tortured genius instead of nerd who was born into the right family with 
      the right connections. 
    </p>
    
    
    
      <p>
      The steady transition of the ruling class from recognizably evil old guys, titans 
      of industry who use their power to crush and manipulate the rest of us, to pale, shut-in nerds
      makes me so goddamnned angry I cannot even put into words. You expect me to bow down...to HIM???? 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Last thing imma say.........if you lost that much money in some countries, they'll lock your ass up for financial crimes.
      Assuming they don't execute you
    </p>
    
     <p>
      Upper-middle class people who LARP as working class be talmbout "eat the rich"...bro you are the rich??
      We're eating you
    </p>

      The French Left and existentialists of the 20th century have produced some of my favorites works.
      It just sucks that they were all sex-fiends

      I used to watch so many damn movies. I keep a list organized by date watched and each one contains a mini-review and some other info like who I 
      watched it with. But over time, the list has started to become more bare. Watching twenty movies in a month soon becomes five. Five soon drops to one. Soon I
      no longer watch movies at all. 
    </p>
    
     <p>
      I'm not even being dramatic. In January 2022, I watched 30 movies. The following month I didn't watch any. In April, the number went up again, but it has been steadily decreasing ever since.
       This month, December 2022, I watched two movies: Hellraiser 3 & Hellraiser 4. And they were both awful.
    </p>
    
     <p>
      The more films you watch, the quicker you realize that most movies are garbage. For every verifiable classic, there are probably a couple hundred that
       are almost unwatchable.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I want to drop out lol
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The Twitter files must be having those former Twitter execs sweating bullets. 
      If I was revealed to have been involved in collusion with the State in suppressing
      free speech with bogus justifications I would be also be nervous. This is what happens 
      when you work with the FBI. The CIA woulda burned all those documents.
    </p>
    
     <p>
      They've been saying Russia is running out of weaponry since they started the invasion. 
       Something tells me they're not running out of weaponry.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Continued thought: With further troop mobilizations, as well as the possibility of Belarus entering the conflict, 
      this war might get ugly and get ugly very fast. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Rappers these days do anything but release music. They're all about fashion now. That'd be fine, 
      it's just that most of the dudes can't design for shit, but it only gets more worse
      cause their dickriding fanboys buy the shitty merch anyway. I'm talking about Playboi Carti btw
    </p>
    
    
    <p>People complain that Westside Gunn and the Griselda rappers release too much music. Good. Prolific rappers reign supreme. Especially if 80% 
    of everything they drop is solid</p>
    
    <p>If you’re worried about AI art putting you out of work, you might just be a shitty artist</p>
    
    <p>Yugioh? More like you get no hoes [might need to workshop this one]</p>
    
    <p>Black people will say that camping/hiking/outdoors stuff is 
      white people shit which is a real insult to the history of black
      explores and frontiersmen. We were cowboys, explorers, and soldiers. 
      An entire lineage of great black pioneers completely erased.</p>
    
    <p>When I wake up there’s a mandatory “lay in bed and reflect for an hour” 
      period</p>
    
    <p>If I start taking pills there’s no coming back</p>
    
    <p>I'm keeping all the actually wild random thoughts in the notes app.
    Y'all niggas ain't ready</p>
    
    <p>
      Invader Zim was for kids that ate glow sticks and glue and had Cheeto fingers
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This is just a neonless dystopia. If I'm gonna live in hell, it could at least
      be pretty.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      D-beat remains the greatest genre of punk music
    </p>
   
     <p>
      I like dubstep, but I don't "like the types of people who listen to it".
       These mfs be weird. The tranistion of edm to music for the weird kids
       to the home turf for internet influencers bothers me. Niggas used to call 
       me gay for listening to dubstep and now it's cool again? I will be avenged.
    </p>
    
    <p>Hiphop is a mixed bag for me. I mostly listen to 90s east-coast gangsta rap or 
      the stuff outta the South (memphis and houston). With the exception of of like 3 people,
      I cannot listen to west-coast
    </p>
    
  <p>Why are you as a man drinking a frappuccino</p>
    
    <p>I've written and deleted so many of these. A few of these might get me 
    in trouble. The rant about polyamory? Right in the trash.
    All the ones I'm blessing y'all with are pretty tame.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      All these art bitches got BPD
    </p>
  
    <p>I am physically incapable of handling someone speaking to me incorrectly. 
       I don't like being scolded or belittled or talked down too like a child. My
      upbringing wasn't terrible, but some parts about it certainly weren't ideal.
      Being spoken to in certain ways conjures a lot of those buried and painful 
      feelings and memories. I don't have a temper and think of myself as cool-headed,
      but once you speak to me like I'm subordinate, issues will arise. We can 
      disagree and argue as equals, something predicated on mutual respect, but the
      moment you try to put me down or
      belittle me or make me feel like I'm less, I will escalate that shit so fucking quickly. 
      Now some might describe this is "P T S D" or something, but I am not some. 
    </p>
    
    <p>Generational trauma is a bitch. Trauma in general. I try not to 
    repeat the actions of those who made me
    the recipient of their pain. But even still, though unintentional, I'm 
    capable of hurting others, just in different ways. When someone loves you and sees
      you in pain and turmoil, but you can't even let them help you because it 
      requires sharing your heart with them, that act will harm them. Being
      shutout and watching someone you love slowly erode is gut wrenching. I realized 
    that, by trying to break the cycle, I found new ways to perpetuate it. 
    </p>
    
    <p>Not everybody is neurodivergent, some niggas is just crazy</p>
    
    <p>My breakfast is pushups</p>
    
    <p>Me and the baddie I pulled by being an unmedicated sweetheart</p>
    
    <p>when i see you imma knock the rings out yo ass [sonic the hedgehog reference,
      might need to workshop as well]
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I make jokes about therapy n stuff, but no shade, there is nothing wrong
      with going to therapy. If you need to talk someone
      you absolutely should. Therapy is great. For you. I will never step in 
      that room again. Ignorance is bliss nigga
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The type of information some people are just willing to share. 
      Like bro...the KGB and Stasi could not have gotten that type of info out of me
      and your ass willingly shared it?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I open my mouth to speak and just hope it all works out. There is no telling what 
      I might say tbh
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I stuttered so bad in a class one time I just 
      gave up mid-sentence and stopped talking. 
      My professor started clowning me too. I almost dropped out
    </p>
    
    <p>
      "Oh you’re from Atlanta? Well call me Sherman cause 
      I’m bout to [work-in-progress]
    </p>
    
    <p>
      People pay to go to escape rooms? Bro I can kidnap you for free [work-in-progress]
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If I'm ever writing politics or articles, for the love of god, just ask how I'm 
      doing. Just make sure I'm ok, because I'm probably not. I only go on my writing
      kick when I am really going thru the motions. The time spent going thru
      HRW and UN infographs and charts distracts me from what I'm feeling. The articles could be
      good if they weren't so incoherent and rambly. Or at least spellchecked.
    </p>
    
    <p>I don't like being told what to do. The only person who has unquestionable
      authority is my mother. 
    </p>
    
    <p>I could've spell checked this or something but I'm real. I write it and keep on rolling.
      Figure out what I meant. bitch
